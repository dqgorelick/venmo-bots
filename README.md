# React Webpack Scaffold

This is definitely not the best webpack starter pack, but it is what I use.

### What does this come with?

- Transpiles es6 to es5 javascript
- Compiles SASS styles to CSS
- Offers build webpack

### Getting started

Clone repo (or fork!)
```git clone https://github.com/dqgorelick/react-webpack-scaffold.git```

Navigate to root directory
```cd react-webpack-scaffold```

Install all node dependencies
```npm install```

Start server
```
node server.js

OR

node server.js <PORT NUMBER>
```

In another terminal window, run `npm start` to run webpack

In browser, navigate to:
```
http://localhost:9000

OR

http://localhost:<PORT NUMBER>
```

### Building
From root directory run

```npm run build```


### Tips
Edit styles in /assets/styles/main.scss

### TODO
- Add hot reloading for sass
- Add hot reloading for react components
